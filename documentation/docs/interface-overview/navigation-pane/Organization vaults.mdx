**Organization vault** is the main vault type and is suitable for most tasks. You can create vaults for various projects, departments, and other divisions within your company. Organization vaults are accessible by Passwork administrators and users to whom they have granted appropriate access rights.

Passwords in vaults can be organized by placing them into folders, you can create as many nested folders as necessary and make a flexible multi-level structure.
