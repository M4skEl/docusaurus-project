### Lock extension

You can **lock** the Passwork extension behind a PIN code for improved security. Enter a 4-digit PIN to set up the locking feature. Additionally, you can enable an auto-lock after a period of inactivity by choosing one of the available interval options.

## API Settings {#api-settings}

To use the Passwork browser extension, you need to enable the Passwork API in your Passwork instance settings. This allows the extension to communicate with your Passwork server securely.

## Ignored sites

Ignored sites tab lists all the websites you added to **Ignored.** Passwork won't save or autofill passwords for sites you add to this list through the [Save and use password](#) prompts.
