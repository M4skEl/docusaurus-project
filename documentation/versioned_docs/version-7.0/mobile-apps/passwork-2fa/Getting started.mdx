**Passwork 2FA** is a mobile app that allows you to confirm your Passwork sign-in in one tap and also use it for two-factor authentication in third-party services.

With Passwork 2FA you can:

- Quickly log into Passwork accounts without using one-time codes.
- Automatically set up two-step authentication with QR codes.
- Use two-factor authentication even without an Internet connection.
- Confirm logins to third-party services and applications.

## Download the app
