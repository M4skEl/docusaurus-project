Preparing the environment for offline installation
Receiving components for Passwork
To install Passwork, you need to download the files and a script that will perform the necessary steps for installation.

Create a directory and move it:

mkdir your_directory
cd your_directory
﻿
Download:

Passwork installation script﻿
Archive with docker-compose build files﻿
﻿Nginx container image
﻿Percona Server for MongoDB container image
﻿PHP container image
﻿Postfix container image
﻿Alpine container image
Receiving Passwork
Go to the customer portal and get the latest version of Passwork and its digitally signed archive:

﻿
You need public.key to verify the digital signature, spobods to get it:



Manual

Open the URL;
Copy the entire contents;
Paste into a file and save with the name — public.key.


Automatic (curl or wget)

curl -o public.key https://passwork.pro/public-key
﻿
Prepare and start the installation
Move the downloaded files to the Linux server in the directory, where you plan to install Passwork — your_directory

In the created directory create a subdirectory — passwork_images
mkdir your_directory/passwork_images
﻿
Move *.tar image archives to — passwork_images
cd your_directory
mv *.tar ./passwork_images
﻿
The structure of files and folders will look like this:
├── Passwork-xxxxxx.zip
├── xxxxxx.sig
├── public.key
├── passwork_compose_install.sh
├── passwork_compose_last.tar.gz
└── passwork_images
    ├── alpine.tar
    ├── nginx.tar
    ├── php8.3.tar
    ├── postfix.tar
    └── psmdb6.tar
﻿
User rights verification and script execution
If you are installing not as root, make sure that the user is a member of the docker group.

You can do it using the following method:

id $USER | grep docker
﻿
You can add a user to the docker group like this:

sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
﻿
Running the offline installation script
Assign execution rights to the script:
chmod +x ./*.sh
﻿
In the directory — your_directory run the passwork_compose_install.sh installation script with the -o flag
./passwork_compose_install.sh -o --skip
﻿
By default, the script will verify the digital signature using the public key. If the signature is invalid or missing, the update will be aborted.

If you trust the source of the archive, you can bypass signature verification:

./passwork_compose_install.sh -o --skip
﻿
The script will automatically execute docker ps. Please check the list of running containers. If the containers were not started, please check the installation output and log. Example of a correct output:

Before configuring a web server with SSL termination enabled, familiarize yourself with the ﻿.

Setup wizard
After building and running the containers, Passwork will be available at the following link: https://your_servername

By default, Passwork uses a self-signed certificate that is automatically generated during installation, so when you first open the page, you will see a message that the browser does not trust the site's certificate.

Choose language
As the first step, the system will offer to choose the interface language:

﻿
Server configuration checklist
The checklist of parameters will show if all necessary components are installed on your server:

﻿
Database connection
You must use the default MongoDB address to connect:

﻿
Passwork configuration
Passwork will generate a new key for server encryption. If you are connecting Passwork to an existing database, specify the existing encryption key:

Do not enter a key that was generated outside of Passwork.
Passwork uses special secure algorithms to generate new keys in appropriate formats. Using keys generated by third-party tools may result in incorrect operation.

﻿
License key
You can download the license keys on Passwork customer portal:

﻿
Setting up your own SSL certificate
By default, Passwork will generate a self-signed certificate during install. When the installation is complete you will be able to start using proper SSL certificates.

Use your own certificate
For certificates issued by a trusted issuer
For certificates issued by domain certification authorities of your organization
Rename your SSL certificate or certification chain and place it in ./conf/ssl 

privkey.pem — private key
fullchain.pem — certificate\certification chain
